.SH "NAME"
dvipng \- A DVI\-to-PNG translator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
dvipng [options] filename
.PP
dvipng [options] [filename] -
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.
The benefits include
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Speed. It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code for \s-1DVI\s0 files. On a
fairly low-end laptop, it takes less than a second to generate 150
one-formula images. This makes dvipng suitable for generating large
amounts of images on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and
others.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
finishes. There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at \s-1EOF\s0 for
further output, unless it finds the \s-1POST\s0 marker that indicates the end
of the \s-1DVI\s0.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Interactive query of options. dvipng can read options interactively
through stdin, and all options are usable. It is even possible to change
the input file through this interface.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Supports \s-1PK\s0, \s-1VF\s0, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, color specials
and simple PostScript inclusion specials.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
and more...
.SH "OPTIONS"
Many of the parameterless options listed here can be turned off by
suffixing the option with a zero (\fB0\fR); for instance, to turn off
page reversal, use \fB\-r0\fR.  Such options are marked with a trailing
\fB*\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-\fR" 4
Read additional options from standard input after processing the command
line.
.Ip "\fB--help\fR" 4
Print a usage message and exit.
.Ip "\fB--version\fR" 4
Print the version number and exit.
.Ip "\fB\-bd\fR \fInum\fR" 4
.Ip "\fB\-bd\fR \fIcolor_spec\fR" 4
.Ip "\fB\-bd \*(N'\fR\fInum\fR\fB \fR\fIcolor_spec\fR\fB\*(T'\fR" 4
Set the pixel width of the transparent border (default 0). Using this
option will make the image edges transparent, but it only affects pixels
with the background color. Giving a \fIcolor_spec\fR will set the
fallback color, to be used in viewers that cannot handle transparency
(the default is the background color). The color spec should be in
TeX color \especial syntax, e.g., \*(L'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0\*(R'. Setting the
fallback color makes the default border width 1 px. 
.Ip "\fB--bdpi\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the base (Metafont) resolution, both horizontal and vertical, to
\fInum\fR dpi (dots per inch). This option is necessary when manually
selecting Metafont mode with the --mode option (see below).
.Ip "\fB\-bg\fR \fIcolor_spec\fR" 4
Choose background color for the images. This option will be ignored if
there is a background color \especial in the \s-1DVI\s0. The color spec should
be in TeX color \especial syntax, e.g., \*(L'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0\*(R'. You can
also specify \*(L'Transparent\*(R' which will give you a transparent background
with the normal background as a fallback color. 
.Ip "\fB\-d\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the debug flags, showing what dvipng (thinks it) is doing. This will
work unless dvipng has been compiled without the \fB\s-1DEBUG\s0\fR option
(not recommended). Set the flags as you need them, use \fB\-d \-1\fR as
the first option for maximum output.  
.Ip "\fB\-D\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the output resolution, both horizontal and vertical, to \fInum\fR
dpi (dots per inch). 
.Sp
One may want to adjust this to fit a certain text font size (e.g., on
a web page), and for a text font height of \fIfont_px\fR pixels (in
Mozilla) the correct formula is
  
  <dpi> = <font_px> * 72.27 / 10 [px * TeXpt/in / TeXpt]
.Sp
The last division by ten is due to the standard font height 10pt in
your document, if you use 12pt, divide by 12. Unfortunately, some
proprietary browsers have font height in pt (points), not pixels. You
have to rescale that to pixels, using the screen resolution (default
is usually 96 dpi) which means the formula is
  
  <font_px> = <font_pt> * 96 / 72 [pt * px/in / (pt/in)] 
.Sp
On some high-res screens, the value is instead 120 dpi. Good luck!
.Ip "\fB--depth*\fR" 4
Report the depth of the image. This only works reliably when the
LaTeX style \fBpreview.sty\fR from preview-latex is used. It
reports the number of pixels from the bottom of the image to the
baseline of the image. This can be used for vertical positioning of the
image in, e.g., web documents, where one would use (Cascading
StyleSheets 1)
  
  <\s-1IMG\s0 \s-1SRC\s0="<filename.png>\*(R" \s-1STYLE\s0="vertical-align: \-<depth>px">
.Sp
The depth is a negative offset in this case, so the minus sign is
necessary, and the unit is pixels (px).
.Ip "\fB--dvinum*\fR" 4
Set this option to make the output page number be the TeX page
numbers rather than the physical page number. See the \fB\-o\fR switch.
.Ip "\fB\-fg\fR \fIcolor_spec\fR" 4
Choose foreground color for the images. This option will be ignored if
there is a foreground color \especial in the \s-1DVI\s0. The color spec should
be in TeX color \especial syntax, e.g., \*(L'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0\*(R'.
.Ip "\fB--follow*\fR" 4
Enable follow mode. One of the benefits of dvipng is that it does not
read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX finishes. This
switch makes dvipng wait at \s-1EOF\s0 for further output, unless it finds the
\s-1POST\s0 marker that indicates the end of the \s-1DVI\s0. This is similar to
\fBtail \-f\fR but for \s-1DVI\s0\-to-\s-1PNG\s0 conversion.
.Ip "\fB--freetype*\fR" 4
Enable/disable FreeType font rendering (default on). This option is
available if the FreeType2 font library was present at compilation time.
If this is the case, dvipng will have direct support for PostScript
Type1 and TrueType fonts internally, rather than using \fBgsftopk\fR
for rendering the fonts. If you have PostScript versions of Computer
Modern installed, there will be no need to generate bitmapped variants
on disk of these. Then, you can render images at different (and unusual)
resolutions without cluttering the disk with lots of bitmapped fonts.
Note that if you have both FreeType and T1lib on your system, FreeType
will be preferred by dvipng. If you for some reason would want to use
T1lib rendering, use this option.
.Ip "\fB--gamma\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Control the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing
color palette.  Default value is 1.0.  For 0 < \fInum\fR < 1, the
fonts will be lighter (more like the background), and for \fInum\fR >
1, the fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).
.Ip "\fB--gif*\fR" 4
The images are output in the \s-1GIF\s0 format, if \s-1GIF\s0 support is
enabled. This is the default for the \fBdvigif\fR binary, which only
will be available when \s-1GIF\s0 support is enabled. See also the
\fB--png\fR option.
.Ip "\fB--height*\fR" 4
Report the height of the image. This only works reliably when the
LaTeX style \fBpreview.sty\fR from preview-latex is used. It
reports the number of pixels from the top of the image to the
baseline of the image. The total height of the image is obtained as the
sum of the values reported from --height and the --depth.
.Ip "\fB\-l [=]\fR\fInum\fR" 4
The last page printed will be the first one numbered \fInum\fR. Default
is the last page in the document.  If \fInum\fR is prefixed by an equals
sign, then it (and the argument to the \fB\-p\fR option, if specified)
is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather than a value to
compare with the TeX \fB\ecount0\fR values stored in the \s-1DVI\s0 file.
Thus, using \fB\-l =9\fR will end with the ninth page of the document,
no matter what the pages are actually numbered.
.Ip "\fB--mode\fR \fImode\fR" 4
Use \fImode\fR as the Metafont device name for the \s-1PK\s0 fonts (both for
path searching and font generation). This needs to be augmented with the
base device resolution, given with the \fB--bdpi\fR option. See the
file <\fBftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf\fR> for a list of resolutions and
mode names for most devices. 
.Ip "\fB\-M*\fR" 4
Turns off automatic \s-1PK\s0 font generation (\fImktexpk\fR). This will have
no effect when using PostScript fonts, since no \s-1PK\s0 font generation will
be done anyway.
.Ip "\fB--noghostscript*\fR" 4
This switch prohibits the internal call to GhostScript for displaying
PostScript specials. \fB--noghostscript0\fR turns the call back on.
.Ip "\fB--nogssafer*\fR" 4
Normally, if GhostScript is used to render PostScript specials, the
GhostScript interpreter is run with the option \fB\-dSAFER\fR. The
\fB\-nogssafer\fR option runs GhostScript without \fB\-dSAFER\fR. The
\fB\-dSAFER\fR option in Ghostscript disables PostScript operators such
as deletefile, to prevent possibly malicious PostScript programs from
having any effect.
.Ip "\fB\-o\fR \fIname\fR" 4
Send output to the file \fIname\fR. A single occurrence of \fB%d\fR or
\fB%01d\fR, ..., \fB%09d\fR will be exchanged for the physical
page number (this can be changed, see the \fB--dvinum\fR switch). The
default output filename is \fIfile\fR\fB%d.png\fR where the input \s-1DVI\s0
file was \fIfile\fR\fB.dvi\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-O\fR \fIx-offset\fR\fB,\fR\fIy-offset\fR" 4
Move the origin by \fIx-offset\fR,\fIy-offset\fR, a comma-separated
pair of dimensions such as \fB.1in,\-.3cm\fR.
The origin of the page is shifted from the default position
(of one inch down, one inch to the right from the upper left corner of
the paper) by this amount.  
.Ip "\fB\-p [=]\fR\fInum\fR" 4
The first page printed will be the first one numbered \fInum\fR. Default
is the first page in the document.  If \fInum\fR is prefixed by an
equals sign, then it (and the argument to the \fB\-l\fR option, if
specified) is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather than
a value to compare with the TeX \fB\ecount0\fR values stored in the
\s-1DVI\s0 file.  Thus, using \fB\-p =3\fR will start with the third page of
the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.
.Ip "\fB--picky*\fR" 4
No images are output when a warning occurs. Normally, dvipng will
output an image in spite of a warning, but there may be something
missing in this image. One reason to use this option would be if you
have a more complete but slower fallback converter. Mainly, this is
useful for failed figure inclusion and unknown \especial occurrences,
but warnings will also occur for missing or unknown color specs and
missing \s-1PK\s0 fonts.
.Ip "\fB--png*\fR" 4
The images are output in the \s-1PNG\s0 format. This is the default for the
\fBdvipng\fR binary. See also the \fB--gif\fR option.
.Ip "\fB\-pp\fR \fIfirstpage\fR\fB\-\fR\fIlastpage\fR" 4
Print pages \fIfirstpage\fR through \fIlastpage\fR; but not quite
equivalent to \fB\-p\fR \fIfirstpage\fR \fB\-l\fR \fIlastpage\fR. For example,
when rendering a book, there may be several instances of a page in the
\s-1DVI\s0 file (one in \f(CW\efrontmatter\fR, one in \f(CW\emainmatter\fR, and one
in \f(CW\ebackmatter\fR). In case of several pages matching, \fB\-pp\fR
\fIfirstpage\fR\fB\-\fR\fIlastpage\fR will render \fIall\fR pages that
matches the specified range, while \fB\-p\fR \fIfirstpage\fR \fB\-l\fR
\fIlastpage\fR will render the pages from the \fIfirst\fR occurrence
of \fIfirstpage\fR to the \fIfirst\fR occurrence of \fIlastpage\fR.
This is the (undocumented) behaviour of dvips. In dvipng you can give
both kinds of options, in which case you get all pages that matches the
range in \fB\-pp\fR between the pages from \fB\-p\fR to \fB\-l\fR. Also
multiple \fB\-pp\fR options accumulate, unlike \fB\-p\fR and \fB\-l\fR.
The \fB\-\fR separator can also be \fB:\fR. Note that \fB\-pp \-1\fR
will be interpreted as \*(L"all pages up to and including 1\*(R", if you want a
page numbered \-1 (only the table of contents, say) put \fB\-pp \-1\*(--1\fR,
or more readable, \fB\-pp \-1:\-1\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-q*\fR" 4
Run quietly.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard
output; report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.
.Ip "\fB\-Q\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the quality to \fInum\fR. That is, choose the number of antialiasing
levels for \s-1PK\s0 and T1lib rendering to be \fInum\fR*\fInum\fR. The default
value is 4 which gives 16 levels of antialiasing for antialiased fonts
from these two. If FreeType is available, its rendering is unaffected by
this option.
.Ip "\fB\-r*\fR" 4
Toggle output of pages in reverse/forward order. By default, the first
page in the \s-1DVI\s0 is output first.
.Ip "\fB\-T\fR \fIimage_size\fR" 4
Set the image size to \fIimage_size\fR which can be either of
\fBbbox\fR, \fBtight\fR, or a comma-separated pair of dimensions
\fIhsize\fR,\fIvsize\fR such as \fB.1in,.3cm\fR. The default is
\fBbbox\fR which produces a \s-1PNG\s0 that includes all ink put on the page
and in addition the \s-1DVI\s0 origin, located 1in from the top and 1in from
the left edge of the paper. This usually gives whitespace above and to
the left in the produced image. The value \fBtight\fR will make dvipng
only include all ink put on the page, producing neat images.
This option overrides any papersize special in the \s-1DVI\s0 file.
.Ip "\fB--t1lib*\fR" 4
Enable/disable T1lib font rendering (default on). This option is
available if the T1lib font library was present at compilation time. If
this is the case, dvipng will have direct support for PostScript Type1
fonts internally, rather than using \fBgsftopk\fR for rendering the
fonts. If you have PostScript versions of Computer Modern installed,
there will be no need to generate bitmapped variants on disk of these.
Then, you can render images at different (and unusual) resolutions
without cluttering the disk with lots of bitmapped fonts. Note that if
you have both FreeType and T1lib on your system FreeType will be
preferred by dvipng, and if you for some reason rather want to use
T1lib, give the option \fB--freetype0\fR (see above).
.Ip "\fB--truecolor*\fR" 4
On systems with a fairly new \fBlibgd\fR, one can choose to generate
truecolor output. This will not be necessary in general unless you
include truecolor images via a PostScript special (i.e., the
\fBgraphics\fR or \fBgraphicx\fR package). It will lead to longer
execution time, mostly because more data is written to disk.
 
.Ip "\fB\-v*\fR " 4
Enable verbose operation. This will currently indicate what fonts is
used, in addition to the usual output.
.Ip "\fB\-x\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the x magnification ratio to \fInum\fR/1000. Overrides
the magnification specified in the \s-1DVI\s0 file.  Must be between 10 and
100000.  It is recommended that you use standard magstep values (1095,
1200, 1440, 1728, 2074, 2488, 2986, and so on) to help reduce the total
number of \s-1PK\s0 files generated.  \fInum\fR may be a real number, not an
integer, for increased precision.
.Ip "\fB\-z\fR \fInum\fR" 4
Set the \s-1PNG\s0 compression level to \fInum\fR. This option is enabled if
your \fBlibgd\fR is new enough. The default compression level is 1,
which selects maximum speed at the price of slightly larger PNGs. For an
older \fBlibgd\fR, the hard-soldered value 5 is used. The include file
\fBpng.h\fR says
``Currently, valid values range from 0 \- 9, corresponding directly to
the zlib compression levels 0 \- 9 (0 \- no compression, 9 \- \*(L"maximal\*(R"
compression). Note that tests have shown that zlib compression levels
3-6 usually perform as well as level 9 for \s-1PNG\s0 images, and do
considerably fewer calculations. In the future, these values may not
correspond directly to the zlib compression levels.'\*(R'
