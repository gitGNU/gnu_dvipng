dvipng
******

This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as obtained
from TeX and its relatives.

   If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using the
`dvigif' binary or with the `--gif' option.

   It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as
fast as is possible. The target audience is people who need to generate
and regenerate many images again and again. The primary target is the
preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from
within (X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs
buffer, see `http://preview-latex.sf.net'.

   Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering
homework problems to students over the internet, giving students
instant feedback as to whether or not their answers are correct, see
`http://webwork.math.rochester.edu'.

   Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as
latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like LyX.

Benefits of dvipng
==================

   The benefits of `dvipng'/`dvigif' include

   * Speed. It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code for DVI files. On a
     fairly low-end laptop, it takes less than a second to generate 150
     one-formula images. This makes dvipng suitable for generating large
     amounts of images on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK
     and others.

   * It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
     finishes. There is a -follow switch that makes dvipng wait at EOF
     for further output, unless it finds the POST marker that indicates
     the end of the DVI.

   * Interactive query of options. dvipng can read options interactively
     through stdin, and all options are usable. It is even possible to
     change the input file through this interface.

   * Supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, color
     specials and simple PostScript inclusion specials.

   * and more...

Installation
============

   Read `INSTALL', included in the distribution.

Usage
=====

   To use dvipng at its simplest, simply type

     dvipng foo

where `foo.dvi' is the output of TeX that you want to convert to PNG
format. If there are four pages in `foo.dvi', those pages will be
output as `foo1.png', `foo2.png', `foo3.png', and `foo4.png',
respectively.

   Many options are available (see the info manual).  For a brief
summary of available options, just type

     dvipng --help

Availability
============

   The dvipng package is available at SourceForge, at
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng'. This is the project page of
dvipng. Anonymous CVS is available from
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex', but this will change
in the future.

Contacts
========

   Bug reports should be sent to <dvipng-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.

   Questions, suggestions for new features, pleas for help, and/or
praise should go to <dvipng-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> (the dvipng
devel team). For more information on this mailing list, send a message
with just the word `help' as subject or body to
<dvipng-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net> or look at
`http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dvipng-devel'.

   Offers to support further development will be appreciated. For

Todo
====

   * Test the FreeType interface so that TrueType fonts work properly.

   * Remove kpathsea dependence, use dvips' environment variables (this
     is maybe less of an issue now with working MiKTeX support).

   * Further speed improvements.

   * Other output specials and source specials.
