Release notes for version 1.2 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release adds GIF support if the drawing library libgd new enough
to support GIF writing. It also adds some command-line switches:
--picky, --noghostscript, --nogssafer, --gif, and --gamma. A few
portability issues have also been taken care of, as well as a bug in
the color special support.

It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
