Release notes for version 0.8 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release adds --depth and --height options for vertical
positioning on webpages and whatnot. It also fixes some bugs, in
particular one that would hang dvipng in certain PostScript font
installs.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
