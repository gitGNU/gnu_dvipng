Release notes for version 1.4 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The 1.4 release restores interactive mode, which unfortunately was
unusable in 1.2-1.3, and resolves a few portability problems. dvipng
now builds on ULTRIX and a few other oldish systems.


It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
