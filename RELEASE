Release notes for version 1.0 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

Dvipng has undergone a number of improvements and bugfixes since being
first released in the 0.x number series a year ago. The 1.0 release
changes the behaviour of the -D switch and simplifies choice of
resolution greatly (see below for details).

It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.

--------------------

People who are upgrading from version 0.9 or earlier should read the
following:

This release changes the -D (resolution) option to specify the
_output_resolution_ rather than the previous base resolution, which
was divided by the shrinkfactor (default 3) to give the output
resolution. This makes the behaviour more similar to that of dvips and
more transparent to new users.

At the same time, new code is added to make it simpler to choose
output resolution. To make the PK fonts render, the old-style call
needed a choice of a base resolution, a "shrinkfactor", a metafont
mode that fit the base resolution, and sometimes a magnification,
making the call to dvipng complicated. For example, choosing 96 dpi
would have needed, say,

    dvipng -D 400 -Q 5 --mfmode nexthi -x 1200 test.dvi 

That is, the base resolution 400, shrinkfactor 5 and magnification 1.2
(400/5*1.2=96). With this version of dvipng you simply say

    dvipng -D 96 test.dvi

The base resolution is no longer a "shrinkfactor" times the output
resolution, so for those who really want to select the metafont mode
there is a --bdpi switch so that this can be done without errors.

In short, choosing resolution simpler by far.
