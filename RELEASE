Release notes for version 1.5 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The 1.5 release fixes a bug in --picky mode and makes it possible to
use dvips' named colors with the -bg and -fg command line switches.


It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
