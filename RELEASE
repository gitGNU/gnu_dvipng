Release notes for version 0.5 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release is a bugfix release. The bounding boxes were "off" on
some machines in the previous release. Preliminary truecolor support
has been added if gd allows it. 

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
