Release notes for version 0.2 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

In this release, a few features are added. It will now do simple
PostScript inclusion, and can in addition do PostScript type1 fonts.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find. I expect that most difficulties will be in building the
package, see README for instructions.
