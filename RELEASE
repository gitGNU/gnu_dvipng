Release notes for version 0.3 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This is mainly a bugfix release: reposition rules, and fix crash on
empty page. In addition, the -o switch is now enabled, so that one can
choose the output filename.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find. I expect that most difficulties will be in building the
package, see README for instructions.
