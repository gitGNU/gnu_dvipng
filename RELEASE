Release notes for version 0.1 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

Initial release. It has been tested but will probably need further
testing. Report any bugs you find. I expect that most difficulties
will be in building the package, see README for instructions.
