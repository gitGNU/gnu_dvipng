Release notes for version 0.4 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release is mainly to provide documentation. It does also
introduce "drift", compensating for rounding errors along the lines
described in 'dvitype'. Also, on systems with a fairly new gd
(>=2.0.14), the PNG compression can be specified on the commandline,
the default is to opt for speed.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
