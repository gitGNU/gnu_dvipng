Release notes for version 0.9 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release adds an --expand-bbox switch, code for getting image size
info straight from preview-latex's "tightpage" option, fixes some
bugs, makes some slight speedups and finally adjusts for freetype
2.1.6 and later.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
