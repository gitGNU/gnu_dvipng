Release notes for version 0.7 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release focuses on PostScript and TrueType font support. If the
FreeType font library is present, dvipng will be able to render fonts
internally, rather than relying on gsftopk. This will reduce disk
clutter, especially when rendering at unusual resolutions.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
