Release notes for version 1.0 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

Dvipng has undergone a number of improvements and bugfixes since being
first released in the 0.x number series a year ago. The 1.0 release
changes the behaviour of the -D switch and simplifies choice of
resolution greatly (see below for details).

It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.

--------------------

People who are upgrading from version 0.9 or earlier should read the
following:

This release changes the -D (resolution) option to specify the
_output_resolution_ rather than the previous _base_resolution_.
Changing output resolution from the default 100 dpi will now only need
the -D option, as dvipng now calculates the required magnification and
thus can render PK fonts suitable for any output resolution. There is
no need anymore to specify by hand the base resolution, the Metafont
mode, the quality, and the magnification.

If you really want to use a Metafont mode different from the default
`cx' mode, the separate --bdpi option is used for specifying the
corresponding base resolution.

In short, choosing the output resolution has become simple even when
using PK fonts (but remember, the created PK fonts are normally cached
on disk).
