Release notes for version 0.10 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

Dvipng has undergone a number of improvements and bugfixes since being
first released in the 0.x number series a year ago. 

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.

--------------------

People who are upgrading from version 0.9 or earlier should read the
following:

This release changes the -D (resolution) option to specify the
_output_resolution_ rather than the previous base resolution (which
was divided by the shrinkfacktor (3) to the output resolution). This
makes the behaviour more similar to that of dvips and more transparent
to new users.

At the same time, new code is added so that it is not necessary to
give a metafont mode to make the fonts render. For those who want to
select the metafont mode there is a --bdpi switch so that this can be
done without errors.

This means that the old-style dvipng call should change from e.g.

     dvipng -D 600 -Q 6 -mode ljfour test.dvi

to
 
     dvipng -D 100 -bdpi 600 -Q 6 -mode ljfour test.dvi

or, if the metafont mode is not really important to you:

     dvipng -D 100 test.dvi

I understand that some users even have used the -x switch to adjust
the output resolution. This is not necessary anymore, which means it
is much simpler to choose output resolution.
