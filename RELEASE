Release notes for version 0.6 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release is a bugfix release. It fixes the documentation
installation and speeds up PostScript inclusion considerably.

It has been tested but will probably need further testing. Report any
bugs you find, see README for instructions.
