Release notes for version 1.3 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The 1.3 release adds the possibility to give a fallback color for the
transparent border, and makes few other small changes.


It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
